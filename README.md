# FPGAProject

###Context
Project for EE2024 that required us to use an FPGA to build an oscilloscope.

###Implementations
Most of the code is in FPGAProject/ProjectFPGA.srcs/sources_1/imports/skeleton_sources/SCOPE_TOP.v

Features:
- Feature 1 (SW0): Wave linker (Joins disjoint curve by drawing vertical lines, especially useful for square waves)
- Feature 2 (SW1): Triggering
- Feature 3 (SW2): R A I N B O W S
- Feature 4 (SW3): Aim Mode (manually adjust tracer to move them for SW1's voltage difference reading)
- Feature 5 (SW10, SW11, SW12): Background Color; Flip the switches to get any color combinations for background
- Feature 6 (SW13, SW14, SW15): Grid Color; Flip the switches to get any color combinations for Grid
- Feature 7 (SW1): Enabled voltage reading in text display
- Feature 8 (SW1): Enabled voltage difference reading between tracer 1 and 2
