# FPGAProject

###Context
Project for EE2024 that required us to use an FPGA to build an oscilloscope.

###Implementations
Most code is in FPGAProject/ProjectFPGA.srcs/sources_1/imports/skeleton_sources/SCOPE_TOP.v
Features:
- Feature 1 (SW0): Wave linker (Joins disjoint curve by drawing vertical lines, especially useful for square waves)
- Feature 2, 7, 8 (SW1): Triggering + Voltage Text Reading (according to target) + Voltage Difference (between tracer 1 and 2)
- Feature 3 (SW2): R A I N B O W S
- Feature 4 (SW3): Aim Mode (manually adjust tracer to move them for SW1's voltage difference reading)
- Feature 5 (SW10, SW11, SW12): Background Color; Flip the switches to get any color combinations
